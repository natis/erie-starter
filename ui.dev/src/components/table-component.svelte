	DEVNOTES:
	The responsive nature of the table for mobile requires some data attribute trickery.
	For example, the data-th attribute is used to provide a label for the data in the table on 
	mobile via CSS (the CSS adds a ::before psuedo element and then the content is set to the value of 
	the data-th attribute).
	We can't rely on a content author to manually add this attribute to each table cell, so we need to have a function
	that creates an array of the values of each TH element and then assigns them to the corresponding TD element.
	This will cause an issue where the first TH element is empty, but the first TD of each TR has a value.
	We should train content authors to not create a table where the first TH element is empty.
	Also the row with tr.mid-table-headline will also need to be done by a content author that has HTML experience.
